   Abstract = {Science and technology policies have recently undergone deep-seated change, with an increasing focus on human resources, on objectives based on outputs instead of inputs, and on the role of firms. At the same time, new data sources have been set up or have become accessible to statisticians (labour force statistics, patent data, innovation surveys). In this context, Ministers of Science and Technology of Member countries asked the OECD to develop new indicators which would more closely reflect the move towards a knowledge-based economy and the impact of policies in the S&T field. This last is.},
